</h1></a>


<h3>Here is the Github search app.</h3>

<p>All in all it was about 20hrs of very fragmented work.</p>

<p>It's a single page Angular app, running on a basic node server.</p>

<p>The styling is mostly Twitter Bootstrap, with a bit of tarting up.</p>

<p>I used Less as a CSS preprocessor and set up a Gulp task to watch for changes and compile.</p>

<p>Dependencies are handled via Bower and dev dependencies via NPM.</p>

<p>I worked a bit of D3 into it too as I love D3.</p>

<p>It's hosted on Heroku and you can take a look at it here <a href="https://gclapham-swan.herokuapp.com/#/">https://gclapham-swan.herokuapp.com/#/</a></p>

<p>To delve into the code, clone the project, cd to the directory, then run:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo npm install -g gulp

    $ sudo npm install

    $ bower install
</code></pre>

<p>Then, to run the server:</p>

<pre><code>$ node server
</code></pre>

<p>and if you want to run the Less watcher to automatically compile when the less file is changed.</p>

<pre><code>$ gulp watch-less
</code></pre>

<p>It was a fun task - the GitHub API is one I've never used and I could have gone on and on with it.</p>

<h3>Stuff I would have sorted - if I had more time</h3>

<p>I noticed, fairly late, that I was getting some 403 Errors when I made too many api requests, as they choke it down when you are making free-form calls to the api without request authorisation. It would have been nice to add a catch for bad requests.</p>

<p>There are no unit tests. It's all a bit quick and dirty, given the timescale.</p>

<p>If you jump to the home page and back to the git page the graph doesn't re-initialise.</p>
