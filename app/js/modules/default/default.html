A search tool for GitHub repositries

Here is the Github search app. All in all it was about 20hrs or extremly fragmented effort.

It is a single page Angular app running on a really basic node server.

The styling is mostly Twitter Bootstrap, with a bit of tarting up.

I used Less as a CSS preprocessor and set up a Gulp task to watch for changes and compile.

Dependancys are handled via Bower and dev dependencies via NPM.

I worked a bit of D3 into it too as I love D3.

It's hosted on Heroku and you can take a look at it here https://gclapham-swan.herokuapp.com/#/

To delve into the code, clone the project, cd to the directory, then run:

$ sudo npm install -g gulp

$ sudo npm install

$ bower install
Then, to run the server:

$ node server
and if you want to run the Less watcher to automatically compile when the less file is changed.

$ gulp watch-less
Stuff I would have sorted - if I had more time
I noticed, fairly late, that I was getting some 403 Errors when I made too many api requests, as they choke it down when you are making freeform calls to the api without request autorisation. It would have been nice to add a catch for bad requests.

There are no unit tests. It's all a bit quick and dirty, given the timescale.
